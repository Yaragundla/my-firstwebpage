    <p> Coronavirus disease <b>(COVID-19)</b> is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.<br>

        Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate <b>respiratory illness</b> and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like <b>cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer</b> are more likely to develop serious illness.<br>

        The best way to <b>prevent</b> and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by <i>washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.</i>

        The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through <i>droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes,</i> so itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).<br>

        At this time, there are <em>no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19.</em> However, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings become available.</p>
